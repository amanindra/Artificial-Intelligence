## Contents

1. problems.in - file with all assumptions and goals (all but one are commented).
2. goals.txt - file with all the goals to prove 12.5 and 12.6 questions.
3. assumptions.txt - file with entire knowledge base to prove
4. scripts file to run all goals individually.
5. Report

## Setup

1. Install prover9 and add it to path
2. `chmod 755 ./script.sh`

## Steps to prove

1. cd to the folder that has scripts file
2. Run `./script.sh` file. This will pick each goal from goals.txt and prove using prover9

## Result
